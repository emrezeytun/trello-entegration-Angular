## How to import your own Trello Board

You can just change `token` , `key` and `idBoard` on  `src/environments/environment.ts` <br>
You can see your token, key and board id on Trello developer page. 

## Application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Development server

First of all you must run `npm install` and  `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
